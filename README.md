The first generation featured both regular and extended cab configurations, with rear-wheel or four-wheel drive options. This generation was built on the GMT355 platform shared with the Chevrolet Colorado.

- **Second Generation (2015-2022)**: After a brief hiatus, the Canyon returned completely redesigned on the GMT 31XX platform. This generation featured more refined styling, improved interior quality, and advanced technology features. Engine options included a 2.5L I4, 3.6L V6, and a 2.8L Duramax turbodiesel. Notable trim levels included the upscale Denali and the off-road focused AT4.

- **Third Generation (2023-present)**: The latest generation Canyon received a complete redesign with a bold new exterior design and significantly upgraded interior. It comes exclusively with a 2.7L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing up to 310 hp in certain trims. The lineup includes the luxury-focused Denali, the AT4 for off-road capability, and the new AT4X as the most capable off-road variant. This generation features advanced technology including a larger infotainment display and enhanced safety features.
